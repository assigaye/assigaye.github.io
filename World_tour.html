            <h2>Formation World Tour.</h2>
            The Formation World Tour was the seventh concert tour by American singer Beyoncé in support of her sixth studio album, Lemonade. The all-stadium tour was announced following her guest appearance at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. The tour started on April 27, 2016 at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida and concluded on October 7, 2016 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, comprising 49 dates. The tour's title is in reference to Beyoncé's 2016 song "Formation".
            The Formation World Tour ranked at #1 and #2 on Pollstar's 2016 mid-year Top 100 Tours chart both in North America and worldwide respectively, with a total mid-year worldwide gross of $137.3 million from the first 25 shows. In total, the tour grossed $256 million from 49 sold-out shows according to Billboard Boxscore, and ranked at #2 on Pollstar's 2016 Year Tours chart.

            <h2>OTR II with Jay Z</h2>
            The On the Run Tour was a co-headlining stadium tour by American performer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z, also known as duo The Carters. The joint tour came shortly after the two had finished their own solo tours — Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Jay-Z's Magna Carter World Tour (both 2013–2014). The tour's name spins off from the 2013 song "Part II (On the Run)", included on Jay-Z's album Magna Carta Holy Grail, on which Beyoncé features.
            Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary. The tour became a commercial success, grossing $96 million in the first 19 North American shows and $109.7 million in total as well as attendance totalling at 979,781. It was the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2014, according to Pollstar's annual year end tour chart.
