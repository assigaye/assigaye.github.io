            Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, born September 4, 1981 is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of her debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), which featured the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy". </p>

            <p> Following the 2006 disbanding of Destiny's Child, she released her second solo album, B'Day, which contained singles "Irreplaceable" and "Beautiful Liar". Beyoncé also starred in multiple films such as The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019). Her marriage to Jay-Z and her portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010. It spawned the successful singles "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and "Halo". </p>

            <p> After splitting from her manager and father Mathew Knowles in 2010, Beyoncé released her musically diverse fourth album 4 in 2011. She later achieved universal acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), the latter of which was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of infidelity and womanism. In 2018, she released Everything Is Love, a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as the Carters. As a featured artist, Beyoncé topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the remixes of "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran in 2017 and "Savage" by Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. The same year, she released the musical film and visual album Black Is King to widespread acclaim.</p>

            <p> Beyoncé is one of the world's best-selling recording artists, having sold 118 million records worldwide. She is the first solo artist to have their first six studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Her success during the 2000s was recognized with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Top Certified Artist of the Decade as well as Billboard's Top Female Artist of the Decade. Beyoncé's accolades include 28 Grammy Awards, 26 MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2014), 24 NAACP Image Awards, 31 BET Awards, and 17 Soul Train Music Awards; all of which are more than any other singer. In 2014, Billboard named her the highest-earning black musician of all time, while in 2020, she was included on Time's list of 100 women who defined the last century.</p>

            Since 2002, Beyoncé has been in a relationship with Jay-Z, with whom she has collaborated on several occasions. Rumours began to circulate about their relationship after their duet on Bonnie & Clyde. Despite persistent rumours, they remained discreet about it. In 2005, rumours spread about the couple's marriage. Beyoncé silenced them by saying that she and Jay-Z were not even engaged. When asked in September 2007, Jay-Z replied, "One day soon, let's put it that way. Laura Schreffler, editor-in-chief of OK! magazine, writes: "These people are very private."

            On 4 April 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z got married in New York. The event was made public on 22 April. Beyoncé did not publicly show her wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on 5 September 2008 in New York. She finally revealed their marriage in an opening video montage at the I Am... Sasha Fierce at the Sony Club in Manhattan.
            <br>
            On 7 January 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to her first child, a baby girl named Blue Ivy, in New York City. On 1 February 2017, Beyoncé announced that she was expecting twins with a series of photographs and a poem entitled "I have 3 hearts" playing on religious codes. Her pregnancy announcement on Instagram became the most liked photo on the site in less than a few hours.
            On 13 June 2017, she gave birth to her twins, a boy, Sir Carter and a girl, Rumi.
